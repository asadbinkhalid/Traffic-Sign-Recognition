## Dataset
- GTSRB dataset is used in this project.
- Download the dataset from this link: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F2F7ZK62CHLIZWoOjEx-2T9OmWb96eDy?usp=sharing> and update dataset folder location in the notebook.
- Original dataset source: <http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset>
- The dataset consists of 43 different classes of images.

Classes are as listed below:

5 = Speed limit (80km/h)
6 = End of speed limit (80km/h)
7 = Speed limit (100km/h)
8 = Speed limit (120km/h)
9 = No passing
10 = No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons
11 = Right-of-way at the next intersection
12 = Priority road
